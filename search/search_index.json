If you'd like help troubleshooting a docs PR you're working on, have a great new idea, or want to share something amazing you've learned in our docs, join us in discussions . 2) Issues # Issues are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. If you've found something in the spec that should be updated, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue and fill out the template. We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix. Create a new issue # If you spot a problem with the project, search if an issue already exists . If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form . Solve an issue # Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. 3) Pull requests for feature proposals and code edits # A pull request is a way to suggest changes in our repository.

Create a working branch and start making your changes! When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR. Fill the \"Ready for review\" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request. Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one. Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information. We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your branch, then commit them to your branch. As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved . If you run into any merge issues, checkout this git documentation on addressing merge conflicts to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues. Caveats for Windows # This project can be developed on Windows, however a few potential gotchas need to be kept in mind: Regular Expressions: Windows uses \\r\\n for line endings, while Unix based systems use \\n . Therefore when working on Regular Expressions, use \\r?\\n instead of \\n in order to support both environments. The Node.js os.EOL property can be used to get an OS-specific end-of-line marker. Paths: Windows systems use \\ for the path separator, which would be returned by path.join and others. You could use path.posix , path.posix.join etc and the slash module, if you need forward slashes - like for constructing URLs - or ensure your code works with either. Bash: Not every Windows developer has a terminal that fully supports Bash, so it's generally preferred to write scripts in JavaScript instead of Bash. Filename too long error: There is a 260 character limit for a filename when Git is compiled with msys .

OCF File Type # OCF is a multi-file format designed to make it easy to split, compress or stream company capitalization tables. A valid OCF cap table is made up of JSON objects that match the schemas available in our repo in the schemas folder. OCF objects are grouped and stored in eight file types (defined in our file schemas folder). There are currently 10 file types that make up a cap table : A Manifest File - The manifest holds basic issuer information and references to the instances of the other 7 file types needed to represent a company's capitalization history. Stakeholders File(s) - One or more files listing all stakeholders of the Company. Stakeholder types are enumerated in our standard, and we welcome comments on how to categorize stakeholders. Stock Classes File(s) - One or more files listing all classes / series of stock issued by the issuer. Stock Legend Templates File(s) - One or more files storing the legends used by the issuer. Stock Plans File(s) - One or more files storing the issuer's stock plans and related information. Transactions File(s) - One or more files storing the transactions for the issuers. Any of our transaction event objects are supported. Valuations File(s) - One or more files storing valuations for the issuer. Vesting Terms File(s) - One or more files storing vesting schedules used by the issuer. Financings File(s) - One or more files storing the issuer's financing events. Documents File(s) - One or more files storing references to related stakeholder documents, either via path referring to a location within an associated ZIP archive (packaged separately from the OCF archive), or via a uniform resource identifier (URI). At the moment, we recommend combining all of these files into a single compressed file with a *.ocf.zip extension: We are working on sample tooling to interact with compressed *.ocf.zip files. You can also break out the various OCF Types and OCF Objects and make those available separately via API or other, suitable mechanism.

Stakeholders File(s) - One or more files listing all stakeholders of the Company. Stakeholder types are enumerated in our standard, and we welcome comments on how to categorize stakeholders. Stock Classes File(s) - One or more files listing all classes / series of stock issued by the issuer. Stock Legend Templates File(s) - One or more files storing the legends used by the issuer. Stock Plans File(s) - One or more files storing the issuer's stock plans and related information. Transactions File(s) - One or more files storing the transactions for the issuers. Any of our transaction event objects are supported. Valuations File(s) - One or more files storing valuations for the issuer. Vesting Terms File(s) - One or more files storing vesting schedules used by the issuer. Financings File(s) - One or more files storing the issuer's financing events. Documents File(s) - One or more files storing references to related stakeholder documents, either via path referring to a location within an associated ZIP archive (packaged separately from the OCF archive), or via a uniform resource identifier (URI). At the moment, we recommend combining all of these files into a single compressed file with a *.ocf.zip extension: We are working on sample tooling to interact with compressed *.ocf.zip files. You can also break out the various OCF Types and OCF Objects and make those available separately via API or other, suitable mechanism. The key part of OCF is the data structure, not the container itself, though, to ensure complete cap table integrity, a full cap table export is recommended.","title":"OCF File Type"},{"location":"explainers/DesignPatterns/","text":"Design Patterns # OCF Types vs OCF Objects # You may notice this distinction in our repo organization, yet both OCF Types and OCF Objects are commonly JSONSchema object types (basically meaning they are JSONs). An OCF Object is a schema with a JSONSchema types of object that MUST have a unique Id field in each instance of its schema. An OCF Type is meant to describe a specific data type that is does not have a unique ID and will be nested somewhere within an OCF Object. These usually have a JSONSchema type of object , but they can also be JSONSchema primitives like strings, numbers, etc. that have specific validation rules (e.g. a regex pattern). They do not have unique IDs. OCF Schemas Rely Heavily on Object Composition Patterns # In order to improve code quality, reduce repetition and provide for a better developer experience, OCF schemas rely heavily on object composition . In the primitives folder , you'll see a folder structure that mirrors the overall /schema folder. Where a number of related OCF Objects or OCF Types share properties, we create a \"primitive\" object in this primitives folder. This primitive's path in the primitives folder must mirror the path to the OCF Object(s) or OCF Type(s) composed from it. We incorporate the properties in these primitives into OCF objects by using the JSONSchema allOf property. Where there are different \"flavors\" of a given primitive - e.g. the primitive ConversionRight is composed into OCF Types of ConvertibleConversionRight , a StockClassConversionRight or a WarrantConversionRight - the final OCF Types / Objects must have a type that holds the specific flavors type enumeration - e.g. STOCK_CLASS_CONVERSION_RIGHT for StockClassConversionRight . This avoids validation problems where two flavors must have identical properties but different allowable property values. Here are a couple of concrete object composition examples: The ConversionTrigger OCF Types like AutomaticConversionOnConditionTrigger and ElectiveConversionOnConditionTrigger are all composed from ConversionTrigger . The primitive can be found at /schema/primitives/types/conversion_triggers/ while the OCF Types composed from this primitive can be found in /schema/types/conversion_triggers/ . All OCF Objects must be composed of the Object which ensures there is a required object id field on all OCF Objects. This can be found in /schema/primitives/objects as all objects in the /schema/objects folder will incorporate its properties. All of our transaction events must have properties listed in the Transaction schema. Then, different groups of transaction events share some common properties, and these are enforced by incorporating more specific primitives - e.g. all issues (whether of stock, plan securities, warrants or convertibles) must incorporate the properties set forth in Acceptance in addition to the properties in Transaction . What's with the empty properties (e.g. {}) in your schemas? # You'll notice that required OCF type and object properties that are incorporated via object composition have empty objects as their schema values in the OCF object schemas (i.e. \"id\": {} ). This is due to how JSONSchema validators interact with the \"required\" property. If validators don't find a required property in an object schema, even if it's one of the primitives the object is composed of, most (all?) JSONSchema validators will throw an error. As a result, we need to add required, \"inherited\" properties to the final OCF object schemas. They don't actually need to be redefined, however, so we just assign these repeat properties a value of {} in the schema as JSONSchema validators can import the property details via allOf. Our documentation generator looks back to the full details of the property from the inherited schemas, however, and the documentation shows the full property details inherited from the primitives. Unless you're developing OCF schemas, these implementation details probably won't matter to you, and you can rely on our documentation for definitive documentation of the necessary properties and all details thereof. Don't Add Additional Properties to OCF # You may notice that the primitive schemas do not prevent the inclusion of additional properties, whereas all OCF Types and OCF Objects that are also JSONSchema objects (basically anything that's not just an enum or primitive data type with validation check) have additionalProperties : false to prevent the inclusion of additional properties. This is due to primitives not being meant for use by consumers of the OCF standard. As we build more complex objects from primitives, we need to allow the primitive to have the additional properties required by the final OCF Objects and Types or else you'd get validation errors. We do not want the OCF Types and OCF Objects that are meant for use by the community to have additional properties, however, as we want to avoid situations where third-parties implementing OCF add custom or undocumented fields and types. This could cause unanticipated compatibility issues and collisions with future versions of OCF, if, for example, a popular implementation of OCF used a custom property with a name that we later want to add to to the official standard.","title":"Design Patterns"},{"location":"explainers/DesignPatterns/#design-patterns","text":"","title":"Design Patterns"},{"location":"explainers/DesignPatterns/#ocf-types-vs-ocf-objects","text":"You may notice this distinction in our repo organization, yet both OCF Types and OCF Objects are commonly JSONSchema object types (basically meaning they are JSONs).

Refresher on OCF ID Types and Uses # Remember, there are multiple IDs associated with issuance transactions, and each has a different purpose: id - every OCF object has an id. This is meant to be a unique identifier within OCF such that no two objects of the same type within a given OCF export have the same id value. (though the specific form is up to a given implementer). While implementers can assign id values that have significance elsewhere in their systems - e.g. using ids that correspond to some significant value in other cap tables or some sort of global registry of securities - we only use OCF id values to identify objects for programmatic processing and extraction of OCF cap table data. security_id - This is best thought of as analgous to a certificate id in the old-fashioned, paper security world. Every issuance has a security_id , and this ID should be used anytime another transaction is acting on the shares issued in the issuance event identified with this security_id . Here are a couple illustrations of where and how security_id is used : To exercise an option, the PlanSecurityExercise transaction refers to a security_id . This must be the the security_id of the PlanSecurityIssuance event used to issue the option being exercised. To transfer shares of stock, the StockTransfer transaction's security_id field should contain the id of the security_id value provided in the StockIssuance event used to issue the original shares being transferred. custom_id - is a freetext field provided to store a certificate ID (or some sort of other, implementer-specific id for a given issuance of securities). share_numbers_issued - is meant to track specific share numbers that are part of an issuance in situations where shares are not fungible. For example, in a jurisdiction where issuing shares 300 - 500 is legall significant and different from issuing shares 700 - 900, you'd need to use this field to track the share numbers that are part of a given issuance. Terminal Transactions # A terminal transaction is an OCF event which acts on a security_id created in one of our Issuance events and, in the process, issues a new security_id for the securities that were issued. Alternatively a transaction which extinguishes issued securities entirely, in which case no security_id applies to them, is also terminal. The following transaction are terminal: Cancellation - transactions composed of Cancellation - which includes StockCancellation , WarrantCancellation , PlanSecurityCancellation and ConvertibleCancellation - all extingush a given security_id and must refer to the pre-exsting security_id of the securities being cancelled. These transactions assume you can cancel an existing issuance in whole or in-part . Their balance_security_id field is meant to be used where an issuance is cancelled in-part and some of the original securities issued under the original security_id remain outstanding, issued to the same stakeholder as the original security_id . Conversion - transactions composed of Conversion - which includes ConvertibleConversion and StockConversion - are terminal. These events must link to the security_id of the original issuance being converted. If the balance_security_id field is present, it means the original security was only converted in-part and the remaining securities have the new security_id provided in the balance_security_id field. Any resulting securities from the conversion - e.g. Stock issued as part of a Convertible conversion or a conversion from preferred to common - should have their issuance ids in the resulting_security_ids field. Exercise - transactions composed of Exercise - which includes PlanSecurityExercise and WarrantExercise - are terminal.

If the balance_security_id field is present, it means the original security was only converted in-part and the remaining securities have the new security_id provided in the balance_security_id field.

Repurchase - StockRepurchase transactions must link to the security_id of the original stock issuance that is being repurchased. Their balance_security_id field is meant to be used where an issuance is only repurchased in-part and some of the original securities issued under the original security_id remain outstanding, issued to the same stakeholder as the original security_id . Reissuance - transactions should be used in situations analagous to where a certificate might be re-issued (such as with new legends). The Stock Re-Issuance transaction must link to the security_id of the original stock issuance that is being re-issued. There is no balance_security_id field as, in such cases, we require an issuance to be re-issued in full. There can be multiple issuances resulting from a single re-issuance, however, so each re-issuance can point to multiple resulting_security_ids . Transfer - transactions composed of Transfer - which includes StockTransfer , WarrantTransfer , PlanSecurityTransfer and ConvertibleTransfer - transactions must link to the security_id of the original issuance the transferred securities were issued as a part of. This transfer can be in whole or in part, and it can be to a single new issuance or to multiple new issuances. If the transfer is in-part, any remaining securities must be issued with a new security_id which should be referred to as the balance_security_id . The security_id s of the resulting issuances to the transferees should be recorded in an array in the resulting_security_ids field.

This is accomplished by expressing security vesting as a graph of \"Vesting Conditions\", and then recording vesting transactions for each security. The current philosophy is that these graphs will be directed and acyclic . Each condition (node) in the graph specifies the trigger (edge) for entering that condition, and vesting some portion or quantity of the linked security. The conditions also then list all possible subsequent conditions. Let's look at some examples. Example 1: Event-based vesting # We'll start with a minimal example of event-based vesting. In this scenario, let's say a Plan Security has been issued but it will not vest at all unless the company is sold for $100,000,000 or more. We can express this as a graph: flowchart TB id(( )) sold[[qualifying-sale: 100%]] id-->|Company acquisition > $100MM|sold And this graph is expressed in JSON as: { \"id\": \"all-or-nothing\", \"object_type\": \"VESTING_TERMS\", \"name\": \"Documentation: Example 1\", \"description\": \"100% of the options vest on a security-specific date\", \"allocation_type\": \"CUMULATIVE_ROUND_DOWN\", \"vesting_conditions\": [ { \"id\": \"qualifying-sale\", \"description\": \"Company is acquired for > $100MM\", \"portion\": { \"numerator\": \"1\", \"denominator\": \"1\" }, \"trigger\": { \"type\": \"VESTING_EVENT\" }, \"next_condition_ids\": [] } ] } Let's break down the single Vesting Condition here. It has trigger.type of VESTING_EVENT . This means that this condition is not met, and thus this portion of vesting does not occur, until an event is triggered and recorded in the transaction log. It has a Vesting Condition Portion portion of 1/1; in other words, 100%. It has an empty array of next_condition_ids . This means this is a terminating node on the graph and is the end of vesting. When the security is first issued, we associate it with the Vesting Terms by ID: { \"object_type\" : \"TX_PLAN_SECURITY_ISSUANCE\" , \"id\" : \"b1746426\" , \"security_id\" : \"vesting-ex-1\" , \"date\" : \"2021-01-01\" , \"vesting_terms_id\" : \"all-or-nothing\" , \"quantity\" : \"500\" , \"...\" } If the issuance is the only transaction object on record, then this issuance is 0% vested. Let's say, however, that a qualifying sale were to occur. To represent this, we add a Vesting Event Transaction to the record: { \"object_type\" : \"TX_VESTING_EVENT\" , \"id\" : \"d0a02b7a\" , \"security_id\" : \"vesting-ex-1\" , \"date\" : \"2022-07-14\" , \"vesting_condition_id\" : \"qualifying-sale\" } This event is linked to the issuance by the security_id field, and is linked to the vesting condition via the vesting_condition_id . This means that on 14 July 2022, a vesting event occurred for the referenced security. The amount vested is derived from: The quantity on the security's issuance event. The portion on the vesting condition qualifying-sale , which is a condition on the security's vesting terms all-or-nothing . This is a simple example, but it also probably isn't a very realistic one. In our next example, we'll show how to add time-based deadlines to an event. Example 2: Event-based vesting with deadlines # Let's say that our hypothetical company has realized that the terms described in Example 1 are not motivating enough, and so they want to add a deadline: The security will only vest if the qualifying sale happens within three years of issuance, or prior to Jan 1, 2025, whichever happens first. Our graph is now a little more complicated: flowchart TB id(( )) start[[vesting-start]] sold[[qualifying-sale: 100%]] rel([relative-expiration: 0%]) abs(absolute-expiration: 0%) id-->|Issuance|start start-->|+3 years|rel start-->|Jan 1, 2025|abs start-->|Company acquisition > $100MM|sold This graph is expressed in JSON as: { \"id\": \"all-or-nothing-with-expiration\", \"object_type\": \"VESTING_TERMS\", \"name\": \"Documentation: Example 2\", \"description\": \"100% of the options vest on a security-specific date, within time boundaries\", \"allocation_type\": \"CUMULATIVE_ROUND_DOWN\", \"vesting_conditions\": [ { \"id\": \"vesting-start\", \"description\": \"The date on which the vesting period begins\", \"trigger\": { \"type\": \"VESTING_START_DATE\" }, \"quantity\": \"0\", \"next_condition_ids\": [ \"relative-expiration\", \"absolute-expiration\", \"qualifying-sale\" ] }, { \"id\": \"relative-expiration\", \"description\": \"0% vesting three years after vesting start\", \"portion\": { \"numerator\": \"0\", \"denominator\": \"1\" }, \"trigger\": { \"type\": \"VESTING_SCHEDULE_RELATIVE\", \"period\": { \"length\": 36, \"type\": \"MONTHS\", \"occurrences\": 1, \"day_of_month\": \"VESTING_START_DAY_OR_LAST_DAY_OF_MONTH\" }, \"relative_to_condition_id\": \"vesting-start\" }, \"next_condition_ids\": [] }, { \"id\": \"absolute-expiration\", \"description\": \"0% vesting after 1 Jan, 2025\", \"quantity\": \"0\", \"trigger\": { \"type\": \"VESTING_SCHEDULE_ABSOLUTE\", \"date\": \"2025-01-01\" }, \"next_condition_ids\": [] }, { \"id\": \"qualifying-sale\", \"description\": \"Company is acquired for > $100MM\", \"portion\": { \"numerator\": \"1\", \"denominator\": \"1\" }, \"trigger\": { \"type\": \"VESTING_EVENT\" }, \"next_condition_ids\": [] } ] } We're introducing a few new concepts here, so let's tackle them one at a time. Vesting Start # The first condition in our array of vesting conditions has a Vesting Start Trigger . This trigger is essentially a special case of a Vesting Event, like from our first example. Since it is the first item in our array of conditions, it is the first node in our graph. Its occurrence is recorded in the transaction log in the same way as a vesting event, but as a Vesting Start Transaction : { \"object_type\" : \"TX_VESTING_START\" , \"id\" : \"08f8b870\" , \"security_id\" : \"vesting-ex-1\" , \"date\" : \"2021-01-01\" , \"vesting_condition_id\" : \"vesting-start\" } Since our terms said the relative expiration is within three years of issuance, in this case, the date of our Vesting Start Transaction is the same as our issuance date. This won't always be the case, as you'll see in other examples. next_condition_ids # Unlike in Example 1, we now have a next_condition_ids that is not empty. These strings are references to the id of other vesting conditions, and indicate the paths we might follow as we navigate our vesting graph. As time passes, or as events occur, we evaluate the triggers for each possible \"next\" condition in the next_condition_ids array order. In this case, after vesting-start has been triggered, we have three possible next conditions: relative-expiration absolute-expiration qualifying-sale Since the two expirations are date based, one way to think about this is a daily evaluation: If relative-expiration 's trigger condition is met, goto relative-expiration and vest nothing, else: If absolute-expiration 's trigger condition is met, goto absolute-expiration and vest nothing, else: If qualifying-sale 's trigger condition is met, goto qualifying-sale and vest 100%, else: Nothing happens Only one path is ever taken, and graphs should be acylic. We've already discussed how qualifying-sale is triggered in Example 1, but let's break down the new triggers. Vesting Schedule Relative # Our relative-expiration condition has a Vesting Schedule Relative Trigger . These triggers are relative to any prior condition that has already been met, as described by relative_to_condition_id . In this case, the period specifies that this condition triggers 1 time ( occurrences ) after 36 MONTHS ( length + type ). Since relative_to_condition_id is vesting-start , this means the condition is triggered 36 months after the Vesting Start transaction. Since the Vesting Start transaction is dated 1 Jan, 2021, this will trigger 1 Jan, 2024. Unlike the Vesting Start and Vesting Event triggers, Vesting Schedule Relative triggers do not have corresponding transactions in the transaction record. Their triggering is implicit based on the passage of time. Vesting Schedule Absolute # Our absolute-expiration condition has a [Vesting Schedule Absolute Trigger][absolute-trigger]. These triggers are met at a specific date, regardless of any other vesting event dates in the transaction log. In this case, the date specifies that this condition would trigger on 1 Jan, 2025. Since that is after the trigger for relative-expiration for this security, it will never happen. If we issued another security with a later vesting start, however, this trigger could come into play. For example, with this issuance: { \"object_type\" : \"TX_PLAN_SECURITY_ISSUANCE\" , \"id\" : \"6174642b\" , \"security_id\" : \"vesting-ex-2\" , \"date\" : \"2023-07-01\" , \"vesting_terms_id\" : \"all-or-nothing-with-expiration\" , \"quantity\" : \"500\" , \"...\" } and this Vesting Start transaction: { \"object_type\" : \"TX_VESTING_START\" , \"id\" : \"80f8b807\" , \"security_id\" : \"vesting-ex-2\" , \"date\" : \"2023-07-01\" , \"vesting_condition_id\" : \"vesting-start\" } the relative-expiration would not trigger until 1 July, 2026 -- so the absolute-expiration will trigger instead. Similar to the Vesting Schedule Relative trigger, Vesting Schedule Absolute triggers do not have corresponding transactions in the transaction record. Their triggering is implicit based on the passage of time. Quantity vs Portion # You may have also noticed along the way that some of the conditions in this example have a quantity key instead of a portion key. All Vesting Conditions support either a relative portion or a fixed quantity of shares. Example 3: Schedule-based vesting # A fairly common vesting structure is one that is fully scheduled, with some kind of delay or \"cliff\" before any vesting begins. For this example, we'll construct a set of terms that correspond to four years, vested monthly, with 25% vested at a one year cliff. flowchart TB id(( )) start[[vesting-start]] cliff([cliff: 12/48]) monthly([monthly-thereafter: 1/48]) id-->start start-->|+1 year|cliff cliff-->|+1 month|monthly subgraph periodic monthly-.->|+1 month, 35x|monthly end And this graph is expressed in JSON as: { \"id\": \"4yr-1yr-cliff-schedule\", \"object_type\": \"VESTING_TERMS\", \"name\": \"Four Year / One Year Cliff\", \"description\": \"25% of the total number of shares shall vest on the one-year anniversary of this Agreement, and an additional 1/48th of the total number of Shares shall then vest on the corresponding day of each month thereafter, until all of the Shares have been released on the fourth anniversary of this Agreement.\", \"allocation_type\": \"CUMULATIVE_ROUNDING\", \"vesting_conditions\": [ { \"id\": \"vesting-start\", \"quantity\": \"0\", \"trigger\": { \"type\": \"VESTING_START_DATE\" }, \"next_condition_ids\": [\"cliff\"] }, { \"id\": \"cliff\", \"description\": \"25% payout at 1 year\", \"portion\": { \"numerator\": \"12\", \"denominator\": \"48\" }, \"trigger\": { \"type\": \"VESTING_SCHEDULE_RELATIVE\", \"period\": { \"length\": 12, \"type\": \"MONTHS\", \"occurrences\": 1, \"day_of_month\": \"VESTING_START_DAY_OR_LAST_DAY_OF_MONTH\" }, \"relative_to_condition_id\": \"vesting-start\" }, \"next_condition_ids\": [\"monthly-thereafter\"] }, { \"id\": \"monthly-thereafter\", \"description\": \"1/48th payout each month thereafter\", \"portion\": { \"numerator\": \"1\", \"denominator\": \"48\" }, \"trigger\": { \"type\": \"VESTING_SCHEDULE_RELATIVE\", \"period\": { \"length\": 1, \"type\": \"MONTHS\", \"occurrences\": 36, \"day_of_month\": \"VESTING_START_DAY_OR_LAST_DAY_OF_MONTH\" }, \"relative_to_condition_id\": \"cliff\" }, \"next_condition_ids\": [] } ] }, A lot of the concepts used here were introduced in Example 2. A security associated with this set of Vesting Terms ... { \"object_type\" : \"TX_PLAN_SECURITY_ISSUANCE\" , \"id\" : \"607e59ab\" , \"security_id\" : \"vesting-ex-3\" , \"date\" : \"2021-01-01\" , \"vesting_terms_id\" : \"4yr-1yr-cliff-schedule\" , \"quantity\" : \"480\" , \"...\" } ... begins vesting when a Vesting Start transaction is logged: { \"object_type\" : \"TX_VESTING_START\" , \"id\" : \"a32bd9ca\" , \"security_id\" : \"vesting-ex-3\" , \"date\" : \"2021-01-30\" , \"vesting_condition_id\" : \"vesting-start\" } Note this will normally be the only vesting transaction in the transaction log for this security, as all other vesting is scheduled and thus the events are implicit based on the passage of time. The vesting-start condition lists a single next_condition_id named \"cliff\", which is configured to trigger 12 months after vesting start on 2022-01-31, and vest 12/48 of the security -- 120 shares. (This portion could just as easily be 25/100, or 1/4; the example only uses the denominator of 48 for consistency.) Once this condition has triggered, the schedule dictates we wait for the next condition, \"monthly-thereafter\", to trigger. This combination of events introduces us to two new concepts. Vesting Schedule Relative occurrences # You may have noticed that the visualized graph for this set of vesting terms appears to have a cycle in it, even though in the introduction we stated that graphs were acyclic. After the initial trigger of monthly-thereafter as we navigate from the cliff condition, this node appears to trigger itself 35 more times. The sub-graph and the dashed line in the graph is meant to imply that this is an internal state of the condition, not a \"next\" condition. This repeated triggering is controlled by the occurrences attribute. In this case, occurrences is set to 36, and the portion is set to 1/48. This means that once this trigger condition is met, it will continue to re-trigger until it has triggered 36 times total. Each time, 1/48 of the security's quantity will vest. Vesting Day of Month # Both the cliff and monthly-thereafter conditions in this example specify a day_of_month attribute with the value VESTING_START_DAY_OR_LAST_DAY_OF_MONTH . This attribute is required for schedule-relative triggers that are specified in months. Possible values are enumerated here . In this case, our value states to use the day of the vesting start transaction or the last day of the month. This explicit requirement is important to handle edge cases such as this one, in which the vesting start transaction occurred on 30 January, 2021. For our cliff condition, the relative time is 12 months. As specified in the schema, months are calendar months, so this condition triggers on 30 January, 2022. The monthly-thereafter condition, however, uses a relative time of 1 month. Since there is no day 30 in February, the \"or last day of month\" logic applies and the first trigger occurs on 28 February, 2022. This would trigger on 29 February in a leap year as, again, relative months are calendar months. Each subsequent occurrence of the periodic monthly trigger would apply the same logic. Since every other month has a day 30, the rest of the occurrences would occur on the 30th of the month. If legal documents specify vesting using 365-day years, relative triggers should be expressed in days instead of months.","title":"Vesting System"},{"location":"explainers/VestingTerms/#vesting-system","text":"","title":"Vesting System"},{"location":"explainers/VestingTerms/#overview","text":"Vesting Terms objects support a structured representation of security vesting. This is accomplished by expressing security vesting as a graph of \"Vesting Conditions\", and then recording vesting transactions for each security. The current philosophy is that these graphs will be directed and acyclic .

The conditions also then list all possible subsequent conditions. Let's look at some examples.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"explainers/VestingTerms/#example-1-event-based-vesting","text":"We'll start with a minimal example of event-based vesting. In this scenario, let's say a Plan Security has been issued but it will not vest at all unless the company is sold for $100,000,000 or more. We can express this as a graph: flowchart TB id(( )) sold[[qualifying-sale: 100%]] id-->|Company acquisition > $100MM|sold And this graph is expressed in JSON as: { \"id\": \"all-or-nothing\", \"object_type\": \"VESTING_TERMS\", \"name\": \"Documentation: Example 1\", \"description\": \"100% of the options vest on a security-specific date\", \"allocation_type\": \"CUMULATIVE_ROUND_DOWN\", \"vesting_conditions\": [ { \"id\": \"qualifying-sale\", \"description\": \"Company is acquired for > $100MM\", \"portion\": { \"numerator\": \"1\", \"denominator\": \"1\" }, \"trigger\": { \"type\": \"VESTING_EVENT\" }, \"next_condition_ids\": [] } ] } Let's break down the single Vesting Condition here. It has trigger.type of VESTING_EVENT . This means that this condition is not met, and thus this portion of vesting does not occur, until an event is triggered and recorded in the transaction log. It has a Vesting Condition Portion portion of 1/1; in other words, 100%. It has an empty array of next_condition_ids . This means this is a terminating node on the graph and is the end of vesting. When the security is first issued, we associate it with the Vesting Terms by ID: { \"object_type\" : \"TX_PLAN_SECURITY_ISSUANCE\" , \"id\" : \"b1746426\" , \"security_id\" : \"vesting-ex-1\" , \"date\" : \"2021-01-01\" , \"vesting_terms_id\" : \"all-or-nothing\" , \"quantity\" : \"500\" , \"...\" } If the issuance is the only transaction object on record, then this issuance is 0% vested. Let's say, however, that a qualifying sale were to occur. To represent this, we add a Vesting Event Transaction to the record: { \"object_type\" : \"TX_VESTING_EVENT\" , \"id\" : \"d0a02b7a\" , \"security_id\" : \"vesting-ex-1\" , \"date\" : \"2022-07-14\" , \"vesting_condition_id\" : \"qualifying-sale\" } This event is linked to the issuance by the security_id field, and is linked to the vesting condition via the vesting_condition_id . This means that on 14 July 2022, a vesting event occurred for the referenced security. The amount vested is derived from: The quantity on the security's issuance event. The portion on the vesting condition qualifying-sale , which is a condition on the security's vesting terms all-or-nothing . This is a simple example, but it also probably isn't a very realistic one.

Note that while this identifier is created with an issuance object, it should be different than the issuance object's id field which identifies the issuance transaction object itself. All future transactions on the security (e.g. acceptance, transfer, cancel, etc.) must reference this security_id to qualify which security the transaction applies to.

Especially important for plan-less options and any issuances from a plan that supports multiple share classes. - compensation_type Enum - Compensation Type Description: Enumeration of equity compensation types (there are some things around the margins like RSAs that don't currently fit under the EquityCompensation umbrella but might arguably fall under this. If you want to create an RSA, create a stock issuance with vesting - you can link it to a plan as well, if you want). The enums stand for: 1. OPTION_ISO (qualified) 2. OPTION_NSO (non-qualified) 3.

If so, it's assumed the vesting schedule will remain in effect but, instead of vesting a right to exercise, it becomes the schedule determining when a right to repurchase the resulting stock lapses. - vesting_terms_id STRING Identifier of the VestingTerms to which this security is subject. If neither vesting_terms_id or vestings are present then the security is fully vested on issuance. - vestings [ schema/types/Vesting ] List of exact vesting dates and amounts for this security.

We're going to work from the OCF files we started in that earlier tutorial. Please go back to to the getting started tutorial if you need a refresher on OCF basics. Create a Stock Plan # Our first step is going to be creating a Stock Plan for Aperture. You need to know a few basic pieces of information to do this. First, you'll need the id of the Stock type you want to put into the option pool. Working from our earlier example, we'll want to issue Common Stock , which, in our StockClasses file, has an id of e1d930f7-592d-4414-a3ab-a78fe4b932d1 . There are 100,000,000 shares of common authorized, so let's reserve 10,000,000 shares to capture a somewhat realistic 10% of the authorized common in the option pool. Here's our new Stock Plan object: { \"object_type\" : \"STOCK_PLAN\" , \"id\" : \"257e5da9-5268-465c-84be-f6d4d4703a9b\" , \"plan_name\" : \"2023 Stock Incentive Plan\" , \"board_approval_date\" : \"2022-12-31\" , \"initial_shares_reserved\" : \"10000000.00\" , \"default_cancellation_behavior\" : \"RETURN_TO_POOL\" , \"stock_class_id\" : \"e1d930f7-592d-4414-a3ab-a78fe4b932d1\" , \"comments\" : [ \"Using new form of SOP released by Firm Y's benefits & comp team on 10/10/2021.\" ] } You'll notice you must also set the default behavior for what happens to shares reserved for a Plan Security issued under this Stock Plan if the Plan Security is cancelled. The default_cancellation_behavior field of the plan object takes a StockPlanCancellationBehaviorType enumeration. The enum gives you four options: RETURN_TO_POOL - Shares return to the pool. HOLD_AS_CAPITAL_STOCK - Shares are held by company as capital stock. RETIRE - Shares are retired entirely. DEFINED_PER_PLAN_SECURITY - No plan-wide default and this is handled on a Plan-Security-by-Plan-Security basis. Create a Vesting Schedule # In order to issue an option, we're going to want to have some kind of vesting schedule. Let's create a (re-usable) vesting object for a standard, four year, one-year cliff vesting schedule. Don't worry, once you've created this once, you can re-use it on multiple options just by referencing its object id. You can refer to our detailed vesting guide for more thorough guidance on constructing vesting schedules, but, for the purposes of this tutorial, here's what our vesting object should look like: { \"id\" : \"f58fa866-be71-4d79-b52a-ea5379a71551\" , \"object_type\" : \"VESTING_TERMS\" , \"name\" : \"Four Year / One Year Cliff\" , \"description\" : \"25% of the total number of shares shall vest on the one-year anniversary of this Agreement, and an additional 1/48th of the total number of Shares shall then vest on the corresponding day of each month thereafter, until all of the Shares have been released on the fourth anniversary of this Agreement.\" , \"allocation_type\" : \"CUMULATIVE_ROUNDING\" , \"vesting_conditions\" : [ { \"id\" : \"3010a0b6-b79f-45c8-9abe-68d827d4dfc9\" , \"quantity\" : \"0\" , \"trigger\" : { \"type\" : \"VESTING_START_DATE\" }, \"next_condition_ids\" : [ \"057d08c6-d7a8-4e0c-917c-bdf610651c25\" ] }, { \"id\" : \"057d08c6-d7a8-4e0c-917c-bdf610651c25\" , \"description\" : \"25% payout at 1 year\" , \"portion\" : { \"numerator\" : \"12\" , \"denominator\" : \"48\" }, \"trigger\" : { \"type\" : \"VESTING_SCHEDULE_RELATIVE\" , \"period\" : { \"length\" : 12 , \"type\" : \"MONTHS\" , \"occurrences\" : 1 , \"day_of_month\" : \"VESTING_START_DAY_OR_LAST_DAY_OF_MONTH\" }, \"relative_to_condition_id\" : \"3010a0b6-b79f-45c8-9abe-68d827d4dfc9\" }, \"next_condition_ids\" : [ \"f8a04380-114a-467a-8d08-e58cf31a9cb4\" ] }, { \"id\" : \"f8a04380-114a-467a-8d08-e58cf31a9cb4\" , \"description\" : \"1/48th payout each month thereafter\" , \"portion\" : { \"numerator\" : \"1\" , \"denominator\" : \"48\" }, \"trigger\" : { \"type\" : \"VESTING_SCHEDULE_RELATIVE\" , \"period\" : { \"length\" : 1 , \"type\" : \"MONTHS\" , \"occurrences\" : 36 , \"day_of_month\" : \"VESTING_START_DAY_OR_LAST_DAY_OF_MONTH\" }, \"relative_to_condition_id\" : \"cliff\" }, \"next_condition_ids\" : [] } ] } Issue an Option # In order to issue something from the \"2023 Stock Incentive Plan\", we'll need a PlanSecurityIssuance event. Let's issue an option to \"Jim Jangles\", our stakeholder with id be7d1e2e-0c9c-485b-a27d-a5c982c4e659 in the samples: { \"object_type\" : \"TX_PLAN_SECURITY_ISSUANCE\" , \"id\" : \"43786349-f791-488f-8da1-687eb25c9603\" , \"security_id\" : \"c0ebbb49-8499-4863-bf27-279bc842bf20\" , \"date\" : \"2022-12-31\" , \"security_law_exemptions\" : [ { \"description\" : \"Rule 701\" , \"jurisdiction\" : \"U.S.\" } ], \"stakeholder_id\" : \"be7d1e2e-0c9c-485b-a27d-a5c982c4e659\" , \"custom_id\" : \"CA-1\" , \"stock_plan_id\" : \"257e5da9-5268-465c-84be-f6d4d4703a9b\" , \"compensation_type\" : \"OPTION\" , \"quantity\" : \"100000\" , \"exercise_price\" : { \"amount\" : \"0.10\" , \"currency\" : \"USD\" }, \"vesting_terms_id\" : \"f58fa866-be71-4d79-b52a-ea5379a71551\" , \"expiration_date\" : \"2032-12-31\" , \"termination_exercise_windows\" : [ { \"reason\" : \"INVOLUNTARY_WITH_CAUSE\" , \"period\" : 1 , \"period_type\" : \"DAYS\" } ] } Note a couple features here: Termination Exercise Windows - OCF lets you enumerate the excercise windows for the option / rsu after any of a number of events. See our Termination Window Types for a full list of supported \"termination\" causes. Securities Exemptions - You can also enumerate a list of applicable security exemptions applicable to a given issuance, including plan securities like RSUs and Options. While this is a convenient feature, the fields are free text, so try to use consistent and/or logical conventions. (Advanced) Change the Option Pool # What happens if you need to increase (or sometimes, decrease) your option pool for a stock plan? OCF has special transaction events to modify certain critical fields in objects like Stock Plan Objects and Stock Objects. Although a bit out of scope for this walkthrough, we'll briefly mention a couple of these events so you can review the concepts separately: Stock Class Authorized Shares Adjustment - records when the authorized shares for a given stock class are adjusted (up or down). Stock Class Conversion Ratio Adjustment - records when the conversion ratio of a conversion ratio conversion mechanism is adjusted (typically due to an anti-dilution mechanism adjusting the conversion ratio in response to a down round). Stock Plan Pool Adjustment - records adjustments (up or down) to the number of shares reserved in a stock plan pool. We'll likely be adding more such adjustment events in the future to adjust specific fields in existing objects and capture these changes over time. To adjust the pool in the \"2023 Stock Incentive Plan\" from 10,000,000 shares to 8,000,000, you'll need a Stock Plan Pool Adjustment like this: { \"object_type\" : \"TX_STOCK_PLAN_POOL_ADJUSTMENT\" , \"id\" : \"increase_sop_pool\" , \"comments\" : [ \"Pool is too large. Decrease to 8,000,000 shares.\" ], \"date\" : \"2023-01-01\" , \"stock_plan_id\" : \"257e5da9-5268-465c-84be-f6d4d4703a9b\" , \"board_approval_date\" : \"2023-01-01\" , \"stockholder_approval_date\" : \"2023-01-01\" , \"shares_reserved\" : \"8000000\" } (Advanced) Exercise the Option # Now, let's say that Jim's 1-year cliff date has passed and he's vested in 25% of his option. He wants to exercise his vested options. How do we model this in OCF? We're going to need a few different objects. First, don't forget to use a vesting start transaciton to specify the vesting commencement date for the vesting schedule we attached to Jim's option: { \"object_type\" : \"TX_VESTING_START\" , \"id\" : \"688f67dd-6e89-4dbc-b2e8-a9511a7cffff\" , \"security_id\" : \"c0ebbb49-8499-4863-bf27-279bc842bf20\" , \"vesting_condition_id\" : \"3010a0b6-b79f-45c8-9abe-68d827d4dfc9\" , \"date\" : \"2022-12-31\" } Now, we need an issuance event for the shares resulting from the exercise and an exercise event to link the share issuance to the option. Issuance { \"object_type\" : \"TX_STOCK_ISSUANCE\" , \"id\" : \"505bc49d-cd87-44cb-87cb-7a6dfe486fe5\" , \"security_id\" : \"6cf44121-67b7-4868-807b-b2581efe6b21\" , \"date\" : \"2024-01-31\" , \"security_law_exemptions\" : [], \"stakeholder_id\" : \"be7d1e2e-0c9c-485b-a27d-a5c982c4e659\" , \"custom_id\" : \"C-1\" , \"stock_class_id\" : \"e1d930f7-592d-4414-a3ab-a78fe4b932d1\" , \"share_price\" : { \"amount\" : \"0.10\" , \"currency\" : \"USD\" }, \"quantity\" : \"25000\" , \"cost_basis\" : { \"amount\" : \"2500\" , \"currency\" : \"USD\" }, \"stock_legend_ids\" : [ \"common_legend_id\" ] } Exercise { \"object_type\" : \"TX_PLAN_SECURITY_EXERCISE\" , \"id\" : \"8efcfd8f-80fc-4f89-ae4f-1fd2c3c5cc2d\" , \"security_id\" : \"c0ebbb49-8499-4863-bf27-279bc842bf20\" , \"date\" : \"2024-01-31\" , \"resulting_security_ids\" : [ \"resultant-security-id-1\" ], \"quantity\" : \"25000\" , \"consideration_text\" : \"2,500.00 USD, Wire\" , \"comments\" : [ \"\" ] } That's it!

We could make up a UUID on the fly, as long as it's consistent across this export, or we could use our internal id. This object would go into the Stakeholders.ocf.json file. { \"object_type\" : \"STAKEHOLDER\" , \"id\" : \"be7d1e2e-0c9c-485b-a27d-a5c982c4e659\" , \"name\" : { \"legal_name\" : \"Jim Jangles\" }, \"stakeholder_type\" : \"INDIVIDUAL\" } Next, we define our StockClass .

Each of our four, core security types has its own transfer event: ConvertibleTransfer PlanSecurityTransfer StockTransfer WarrantTransfer Don't forget that OCF is event-driven. You do not want to mutate (or change) the OCF objects that already exist. So, for example, if you had a stock issuance to Bob, and Bob now wants to transfer all of his shares to Alice, if you look at the transfer schema, you'll probably notice a problem: \"properties\": { \"object_type\": { \"const\": \"TX_STOCK_TRANSFER\" }, \"quantity\": { \"description\": \"Quantity of non-monetary security units transferred\", \"$ref\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Open-Cap-Table-Coalition/Open-Cap-Format-OCF/main/schema/types/Numeric.schema.json\" }, \"id\": {}, \"comments\": {}, \"security_id\": {}, \"date\": {}, \"consideration_text\": {}, \"balance_security_id\": {}, \"resulting_security_ids\": {} }, We know the security_id of the source stock from its original issuance event. We also know from that issuance that Bob is the stakehoder-owner of the stock. But how does Alice come into play? You'll notice that not only does the transaction object have a source security_id , there is also a field for resulting_security_ids . This should point to the issuance(s) that result from this transfer. So, in fact, to model a simple transfer from Bob to Alice, you need two events - a StockIssuance to Alice and the transfer linking Bob's stock to Alice's. If Bob has any remaining shares following the issuance, his remaining shares get a new security_id via another issuance event and the transfer's balance_security_id should point to that new security_id. If Bob transfers all of his shares, nothing further is required. Anyone traversing the events should be able to see that Bob's stock was transfered in its entirety to the security_ids in resulting_security_ids on the transfer. Let's walk through it in depth. Walkthrough # Note: We have a company with a StockClass with ID SeriesA and a name of Series A Preferred Stock . 1. Initial Stock Issuance # The Company wants to issue 1,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to Bob Immaperson. To do this, create a StockIssuance event in your OCF event stack: { \"object_type\": \"TX_STOCK_ISSUANCE\", \"id\": \"give-bob-some-stock\", \"security_id\": \"bob-stock-1\", \"date\": \"2022-02-01\", \"security_law_exemptions\": [], \"stakeholder_id\": \"bob\", \"custom_id\": \"PA-1\", \"stock_class_id\": \"SeriesA\", \"share_price\": { \"amount\": \"1.00\", \"currency\": \"USD\" }, \"quantity\": \"1000\", \"cost_basis\": { \"amount\": \"1.00\", \"currency\": \"USD\" }, \"stock_legend_ids\": [ \"series-a-legend\", ] }, Note: we are assuming you have a stakeholder object with id bob and a StockLegend with id series-a-legend . 2.

Create a new issuance for Alice in your event stack: { \"object_type\": \"TX_STOCK_ISSUANCE\", \"id\": \"give-alice-the-stock\", \"security_id\": \"alice-stock-1\", \"date\": \"2023-02-01\", \"security_law_exemptions\": [], \"stakeholder_id\": \"alice\", \"custom_id\": \"PA-23\", \"stock_class_id\": \"SeriesA\", \"share_price\": { \"amount\": \"2.73\", \"currency\": \"USD\" }, \"quantity\": \"1000\", \"cost_basis\": { \"amount\": \"2.73\", \"currency\": \"USD\" }, \"stock_legend_ids\": [ \"series-a-legend\" ] } Again, we assume you've created a stakeholder object for Alice. 3.
