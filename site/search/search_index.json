What is OCF? OCF (or O pen C ap Table F ormat) is a data standard developed by the Open Cap Table Coalition to enable the easy and accurate exchange and use of company capitalization information through a standardized format. It is made freely available for anyone to use, though changes must be made through the Coalition's change process . How Does It Work? OCF File Types OCF is a multi-file format designed to make it easy to split, compress or stream company capitalization tables. A valid OCF cap table is made up of JSON objects that match the schemas available in our repo in the Schemas folder . OCF objects are grouped and stored in eight file types (defined in our file schemas folder ). There are currently 8 file types that make up a cap table: A Manifest File - The manifest holds basic issuer information and references to the instances of the other 7 file types needed to represent a company's capitalization history. Stakeholders File(s) - One or more files listing all stakeholders of the Company. Stakeholder types are enumerated in our standard, and we welcome comments on how to categorize stakeholders. Stock Classes File(s) - One or more files listing all classes / series of stock issued by the issuer. Stock Legend Templates File(s) - One or more files storing the legends used by the issuer. Stock Plans File(s) - One or more files storing the issuer's stock plans and related information. Transactions File(s) - One or more files storing the transactions for the issuers. Any of our transaction event objects are supported. Valuations File(s) - One or more files storing valuations for the issuer. Vesting Schedules File(s) - One or more files storing vesting schedules used by the issuer. At the moment, we recommend combining all of these files into a single compressed file with a *.ocf.zip extension: We are working on sample tooling to interact with compressed *.ocf.zip files. You can also break out the various OCF Types and OCF Objects and make those available separately via API or other, suitable mechanism. The key part of OCF is the data structure, not the container itself, though, to ensure complete cap table integrity, a full cap table export is recommended. Event-Driven Architecture OCF is powered by an event-driven architecture. All Stocks, Plan Securities, Warrants and Convertibles have object-specific events that are added to an event \"stack\" to represent the history of that security. These events describe the relevant data needed to describe key events such as issuances, transfers, conversions, etc. You can see a full list of event transactions supported in our transactions schemas folder . Here's an example of how an event stack would work to track the lifecycle of a single issuance of preferred stock: Key OCF Concepts OCF is designed to be extremely expressive and extensible. Pay particular attention to vesting and conversion, which have both been designed to support the types of complex, bespoke vesting and conversion conditions commonly found on attorney-drafted options and convertibles yet are (today) challenging to model in a structured format Conversions The conversion of one OCF security into another is modeled using three key concepts which describe how, when and into what a convertible security converts into: Conversion Right : what can the security convert into? Conversion Trigger : when and under what conditions does the Conversion Right come into effect? Conversion Mechanism : how is the coversion amount calculated? We use the same design patterns for convertible stock (e.g. preferred stock converting into common), warrants (which don't \"convert\" but can be \"exercised\") and convertible securities (e.g. notes). Let's illustrate the design pattern using a convertible note as an example: And here's what some sample data looks like in practice: Vesting Our vesting data model supports arbitrarily-complex trees of dependent vesting conditions that can mix time-based and event-based vesting (e.g. vesting over time and \"milestone\" vesting, in any execution order with any desired dependencies). We are working on more comprehensive documentation for these concepts. In the meantime, please review the vesting terms object (essentially a \"vesting schedule\"). the vesting OCF Types in /schema/types/vesting , and the vesting events in /schema/objects/transactions/vesting (which are used to indicate when a given vesting schedule starts for a given security and when a milestone-based condition is satisfied). You can see example vesting schedules in our samples folder in the VestingTerms.ocf.json file. Stay tuned for expanded documentation! Overall Repo Organization Full documentation is available in the docs folder . Our documentation is auto-generated and our toolchain is still being refined, so the layout may continue to change and improve. Schemas are divided into five folders: Files Describes the eight top-level files that hold OCF objects and are required to export or import a cap table.

Since not all months have 29, 30, or 31 days, this enum requires those values to also specify an overflow behavior. 01 - 28 : Day 1, 2... 28 of the month; e.g. 03 means vesting occurs on the 3rd of the month. 29_OR_LAST_DAY_OF_MONTH - 31_OR_LAST_DAY_OF_MONTH : Day 29, 30, or 31 of the month, defaulting to the last day of the month for shorter months; e.g. 31_OR_LAST_DAY_OF_MONTH means monthly vesting occurs on Jan 31, Feb 28/29, Mar 31, Apr 30, etc. VESTING_START_DAY_OR_LAST_DAY_OF_MONTH vests on the same day of month as the day of the VESTING_START condition; e.g. if vesting commences on Jan 15 then any vesting will accrue on the 15th of future vesting months. If vesting commencement occurs on days 29-31, this has the same behavior as the other *_LAST_DAY_OF_MONTH values.

Code formatter\" Development Environment Setup This repo requires Prettier to be run on all files. Run npm install to install dev dependencies and Prettier will automatically run pre-commit. OCF Types vs OCF Objects You may notice this distinction in our repo organization, yet both OCF Types and OCF Objects are commonly JSONSchema object types (basically meaning they are JSONs). An OCF Object is a schema with a JSONSchema types of object that MUST have a unique Id field in each instance of its schema. An OCF Type is meant to describe a specific data type that is does not have a unique ID and will be nested somewhere within an OCF Object. These usually have a JSONSchema type of object , but they can also be JSONSchema primitives like strings, numbers, etc. that have specific validation rules (e.g. a regex pattern). They do not have unique IDs. OCF Schemas Rely Heavily on Object Composition Patterns In order to improve code quality, reduce repetition and provide for a better developer experience, OCF schemas rely heavily on object composition . In the primitives folder , you'll see a folder structure that mirrors the overall /schema folder. Where a number of related OCF Objects or OCF Types share properties, we create a \"primitive\" object in this primitives folder. This primitive's path in the primitives folder must mirror the path to the OCF Object(s) or OCF Type(s) composed from it. We incorporate the properties in these primitives into OCF objects by using the JSONSchema allOf property. Where there are different \"flavors\" of a given base - e.g. the primitive BaseConversionRight is composed into OCF Types of ConvertibleConversionRight , a StockClassConversionRight or a WarrantConversionRight - the final OCF Types / Objects must have a type that holds the specific flavors type enumeration - e.g. STOCK_CLASS_CONVERSION_RIGHT for StockClassConversionRight . This avoids validation problems where two flavors must have identical properties but different allowable property values. Here are a couple of concrete object composition examples: The ConversionTrigger OCF Types like AutomaticConversionOnConditionTrigger and ElectiveConversionOnConditionTrigger are all composed from BaseConversionTrigger . The primitive can be found at /schema/primitives/types/conversion_triggers/ while the OCF Types composed from this primitive can be found in /schema/types/conversion_triggers/ objects folder . All OCF Objects must be composed of the BaseObject which ensures there is a required object id field on all OCF Objects. This can be found in /schema/primitives/objects as all objects in the /schema/objects folder will incorporate its properties. All of our transaction events must have properties listed in the BaseTransaction schema. Then, different groups of transaction events share some common properties, and these are enforced by incorporating more specific primitives - e.g. all issues (whether of stock, plan securities, warrants or convertibles) must incorporate the properties set forth in BaseAcceptance in addition to the properties in BaseTransaction . What's with the empty properties (e.g. {}) in your schemas? You'll notice that required OCF type and object properties that are incorporated via object composition have empty objects as their schema values in the OCF object schemas (i.e. \"id\": {} ). This is due to how JSONSchema validators interact with the \"required\" property. If validators don't find a required property in an object schema, even if it's one of the primitives the object is composed of, most (all?) JSONSchema validators will throw an error. As a result, we need to add required, \"inherited\" properties to the final OCF object schemas. They don't actually need to be redefined, however, so we just assign these repeat properties a value of {} in the schema as JSONSchema validators can import the property details via allOf. Our documentation generator looks back to the full details of the property from the inherited schemas, however, and the documentation shows the full property details inherited from the primitives. Unless you're developing OCF schemas, these implementation details probably won't matter to you, and you can rely on our documentation for definitive documentation of the necessary properties and all details thereof. Don't Add Additional Properties to OCF You may notice that the primitive schemas do not prevent the inclusion of additional properties, whereas all OCF Types and OCF Objects that are also JSONSchema objects (basically anything that's not just an enum or primitive data type with validation check) have additionalProperties : false to prevent the inclusion of additional properties. This is due to primitives not being meant for use by consumers of the OCF standard. As we build more complex objects from primitives, we need to allow the primitive to have the additional properties required by the final OCF Objects and Types or else you'd get validation errors. We do not want the OCF Types and OCF Objects that are meant for use by the community to have additional properties, however, as we want to avoid situations where third-parties implementing OCF add custom or undocumented fields and types. This could cause unanticipated compatibility issues and collisions with future versions of OCF, if, for example, a popular implementation of OCF used a custom property with a name that we later want to add to to the official standard. Testing We have created npm scripts to perform various validations, such as validating the schemas themselves and our example ocf object instances: To validate schemas in the repo, run npm run validate-ocf-file-schemas To validate examples in the repo, run npm run validate-example-ocf-files If you want to use the validator for your own files, you can run the following command from the repo root: node ./utils/validate.mjs validate-ocf-director -p [path/to/ocf/files] -v Feel free to omit the -v if you don't want full console logs of the validation process We'll be releasing more complete documentation for validating and packaging in the future.

An OCF Object is a schema with a JSONSchema types of object that MUST have a unique Id field in each instance of its schema. An OCF Type is meant to describe a specific data type that is does not have a unique ID and will be nested somewhere within an OCF Object. These usually have a JSONSchema type of object , but they can also be JSONSchema primitives like strings, numbers, etc. that have specific validation rules (e.g. a regex pattern). They do not have unique IDs.","title":"OCF Types vs OCF Objects"},{"location":"#ocf-schemas-rely-heavily-on-object-composition-patterns","text":"In order to improve code quality, reduce repetition and provide for a better developer experience, OCF schemas rely heavily on object composition . In the primitives folder , you'll see a folder structure that mirrors the overall /schema folder. Where a number of related OCF Objects or OCF Types share properties, we create a \"primitive\" object in this primitives folder. This primitive's path in the primitives folder must mirror the path to the OCF Object(s) or OCF Type(s) composed from it. We incorporate the properties in these primitives into OCF objects by using the JSONSchema allOf property. Where there are different \"flavors\" of a given base - e.g. the primitive BaseConversionRight is composed into OCF Types of ConvertibleConversionRight , a StockClassConversionRight or a WarrantConversionRight - the final OCF Types / Objects must have a type that holds the specific flavors type enumeration - e.g. STOCK_CLASS_CONVERSION_RIGHT for StockClassConversionRight . This avoids validation problems where two flavors must have identical properties but different allowable property values. Here are a couple of concrete object composition examples: The ConversionTrigger OCF Types like AutomaticConversionOnConditionTrigger and ElectiveConversionOnConditionTrigger are all composed from BaseConversionTrigger . The primitive can be found at /schema/primitives/types/conversion_triggers/ while the OCF Types composed from this primitive can be found in /schema/types/conversion_triggers/ objects folder . All OCF Objects must be composed of the BaseObject which ensures there is a required object id field on all OCF Objects. This can be found in /schema/primitives/objects as all objects in the /schema/objects folder will incorporate its properties. All of our transaction events must have properties listed in the BaseTransaction schema. Then, different groups of transaction events share some common properties, and these are enforced by incorporating more specific primitives - e.g. all issues (whether of stock, plan securities, warrants or convertibles) must incorporate the properties set forth in BaseAcceptance in addition to the properties in BaseTransaction .","title":"OCF Schemas Rely Heavily on Object Composition Patterns"},{"location":"#whats-with-the-empty-properties-eg-in-your-schemas","text":"You'll notice that required OCF type and object properties that are incorporated via object composition have empty objects as their schema values in the OCF object schemas (i.e. \"id\": {} ). This is due to how JSONSchema validators interact with the \"required\" property. If validators don't find a required property in an object schema, even if it's one of the primitives the object is composed of, most (all?) JSONSchema validators will throw an error. As a result, we need to add required, \"inherited\" properties to the final OCF object schemas. They don't actually need to be redefined, however, so we just assign these repeat properties a value of {} in the schema as JSONSchema validators can import the property details via allOf. Our documentation generator looks back to the full details of the property from the inherited schemas, however, and the documentation shows the full property details inherited from the primitives. Unless you're developing OCF schemas, these implementation details probably won't matter to you, and you can rely on our documentation for definitive documentation of the necessary properties and all details thereof.","title":"What's with the empty properties (e.g. {}) in your schemas?"},{"location":"#dont-add-additional-properties-to-ocf","text":"You may notice that the primitive schemas do not prevent the inclusion of additional properties, whereas all OCF Types and OCF Objects that are also JSONSchema objects (basically anything that's not just an enum or primitive data type with validation check) have additionalProperties : false to prevent the inclusion of additional properties. This is due to primitives not being meant for use by consumers of the OCF standard. As we build more complex objects from primitives, we need to allow the primitive to have the additional properties required by the final OCF Objects and Types or else you'd get validation errors. We do not want the OCF Types and OCF Objects that are meant for use by the community to have additional properties, however, as we want to avoid situations where third-parties implementing OCF add custom or undocumented fields and types. This could cause unanticipated compatibility issues and collisions with future versions of OCF, if, for example, a popular implementation of OCF used a custom property with a name that we later want to add to to the official standard.","title":"Don't Add Additional Properties to OCF"},{"location":"#testing","text":"We have created npm scripts to perform various validations, such as validating the schemas themselves and our example ocf object instances: To validate schemas in the repo, run npm run validate-ocf-file-schemas To validate examples in the repo, run npm run validate-example-ocf-files If you want to use the validator for your own files, you can run the following command from the repo root: node ./utils/validate.mjs validate-ocf-director -p [path/to/ocf/files] -v Feel free to omit the -v if you don't want full console logs of the validation process We'll be releasing more complete documentation for validating and packaging in the future.
