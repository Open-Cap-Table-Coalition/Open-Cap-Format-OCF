If you want to create an RSA, create a stock issuance with vesting - you can link it to a plan as well, if you want).\n\n**The enums stand for:**\n1. OPTION_ISO (qualified)\n2. OPTION_NSO (non-qualified)\n3. OPTION (not NSO or ISO)\n4. RSU (restricted share units)\n5. CSAR(cash-settled stock appreciation rights)\n6. SSAR(stock-settled stock appreciation rights)",
